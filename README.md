# 429-chat
COMP-429 Project 1

Brian started by building the frame for our peer-to-peer chat. He flushed out alot of necessary features and began to setup. I (Josh: Rinzlo) took up the command line interface parsing for the user. Brian built the helper tools and I added certain tweaks that the cli needed. We worked to bridge it all together and voila, A peer-to-peer chat app!
